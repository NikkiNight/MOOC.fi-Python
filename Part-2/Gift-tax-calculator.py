"According to the Finnish Tax Administration, a gift is a transfer of property to another person against no compensation or payment.
If the total value of the gifts you receive from the same donor in the course of 3 years is â‚¬5,000 or more, you must pay gift tax.
When the gift is received from a close relative or a family member, the amount of tax to be paid can be found on this website: https://www.vero.fi/en/individuals/property/gifts/gift-tax-calculator/
Please write a program which calculates the correct amount of tax for a gift from a close relative."
